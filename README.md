# try_platform_aws_azure_for_machine_learning
Why am I trying this different platform? Since I only used machine learning and deep learning model for researches or non-profit projects use. At that time, we built our own cloud server with our GPU Nvidia 1080Ti and 2080Ti, so I didn't use neither Azure Databricks or AWS SageMaker. While in industries, these main platforms are widely used for design and deployment.
